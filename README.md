# Hey

This is the probation project at VNG. In this project, we will use Reac JS, Java Vert.x with Redis to simulate a simple chat application.

The project will have following functions:

- Sign In
- Sign Up
- Chat with Other Person in friend list
- Chat in group
- Add new friend
- View Online/Offline friend along with their status
- Set Status
- Receive notification about Online/Offline friend in friend list

To achieve these functionalities, we will use following technology stack:

- React JS with Redux for client side development
- Ant.design for UI/UX design
- Java Vert.x for develop the API server
- Websocket for messanging and instant notification
- Redis as database
